# Game outline
#The game is a clone of the original Legend of Zelda game, we want to make a game that closely mimics the combat mechanics of the original #game, but we would also add a new comprehensive mapping progression system and art style that appeals to a 12-year-old (brighter and more #colourful as opposed to gory and dark). 

# Storyline
#The basic premise of the story is about a girl sleeping with her favourite teddy who is lost in deep sleep. She dreams about herself stuck #in the basement without her teddy which is still in her room. Her mission is to get back to her room by facing her worst fears, such as #vegetables, insects and clowns. The interaction with her fears will be like the enemies in the original legend of Zelda, but with #different kill mechanics and movement patterns. Throughout her journey to reach to her room she will encounter objects that she can pick #up to attack (For example a spoon), gain back her health (milk/juice) and bonus items (toys) to add bonus points to the final score. Upon #reaching her bedroom she will encounter the clown which will be the final boss for the game. She must eliminate the clown to get the teddy #and wake up.
